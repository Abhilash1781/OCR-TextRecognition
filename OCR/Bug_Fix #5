**ISSUE - #5**

**BUG-NoneType object has no attribute 'copy' **

This error occured due to not providing the file path or invalid file path given to cv2.imread function . Actually cv2.imread does not explicitely throws an error that given path is invalid instead it will return None.
There's a line in OCRTextRecg.py file --> image = cv2.imread(args["image"]) . If you clearly observe there's a variable called "args" . This variable contains all arguments which is need to be parsed.
This is one of the argument in the args variable.
ap.add_argument("-i", "--image", type=str,
help="path to input image")
The above two lines requests user to provide a file path to the image .

ap.add_argument("-east", "--east", type=str,
help="path to input EAST text detector")
This requests user to provide the file path of east text detector

TYPE 1 OF RUNNING THIS PYTHON FILE
We will typically click on 'RUN' option to run this script , it tries to get the file path , error occurs

HOW WE NEED TO RUN THIS SCRIPT
1)Open the working directory of file in command prompt
2) enter python OCRTextRecg.py -i=complete file path of the image -east=complete file path of East text detector
for example : OCRTextRecg.py -i=C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\tess\image.jpg
-east=C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\tess\frozen_east_test_detection.pb
